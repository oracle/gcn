# Graal Cloud Native (GCN)

Graal Cloud Native (GCN) is a full stack framework for building portable cloud-native applications using the Java ecosystem on top of managed services in the public cloud. GCN is built on top of the GraalVM native image, the MicronautÂ® framework, public cloud SDKs, popular drivers, and a set of open source libraries tested, certified, and supported by Oracle. Oracle has optimized this stack for native image as well as for cloud portability. With GCN, cloud users can focus less on language portability and more on portability across cloud vendors.

## Installation

The GCN CLI will be available soon. In the meantime, use the [Launcher on the GCN website][launcher] to create GCN applications.
